          "data": "The European Policy Centre strongly condemns Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Its latest acts of military aggression are horrific, unjustified and are in gross violation of international law. There is no doubt their attack will lead to immense human suffering and loss of life.\n\nIt is the people of Ukraine that are now at the forefront of our minds. As they brave death and destruction and valiantly defend their country against Russian terror, we stand by Ukraine and unequivocally support its right as a sovereign state to determine its own future. In the words of European Commission President von der Leyen, “we will not let Russia replace the rule of law with the rule of force and ruthlessness”.\n\nOur mission and work as an organisation are dedicated to upholding and advocating democracy, international cooperation, solidarity, and truth-telling – all the things Putin’s regime abhors and is trying to undo with this act of war. In solidarity with our Ukrainian friends and to keep the free Ukrainian voice in the debate, we are offering free EPC membership to any Ukrainian institution, think tank, and NGO committed to a free and democratic Ukraine.\n\nMake no mistake. What is happening in Ukraine is a direct threat to the global and European security orders put in place 75 years ago. It is a direct threat to the European Union and what it stands for. It is a direct threat to independent liberal democracies everywhere and the values we hold dear: freedom, plurality, equality and respect for the rule of law.\n\nThe time that we thought an all-out war could never touch Europe again is over. But although the situation is bleak, we must take heart in the renewed resolve of the EU and the transatlantic alliance to act together and defend those values. Every time we honour our commitments to our partners, our agreements and our ideals, we prove the likes of Putin wrong and demonstrate that the way forward is not by brute power. In the face of relentless obfuscation and blind aggression, the European Policy Centre is more committed than ever to championing those ideas.",

He would also have purported the ancient Greek theory of the four humors, these being one of the few aspects that might be passed from parents to children.\\n\\nThe circumstances of conception and development were thought significantly more critical to the resulting traits of the child up until the end of the eighteenth century, and until Charles Darwin, in the mid-nineteenth, for heredity to emerge as a central problem in biology. At this point, the properties that an individual inherits became less separated from ones inherited on the species-level in the eyes of science, and modern 20th-century molecular biology generated a plethora of supporting information that confirmed the relationship between individual variation and evolution"

Gametes are the reproductive cells of an organism, which is sperm in males and ova in females. Each of these carries 23 of the 46 chromosomes needed to create a complete human genome, and come together to form a zygote.\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms to develop genetic variation occur at each of these stages. Before the gametes are formed homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of genes on each chromosome. Then during the generation of the gametes by meiosis, the homologous chromosomes are distributed randomly, ensuring that each gamete is unique."

          "data": "Since people possess a homologous pair of each chromosome, usually one from the father and one from the mother, many genes are presented twice. Variations in the sequence of these genes are called alleles, and differing alleles may interact in a variety of ways depending on the chromosome on which they are located, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic effects.\\n\\nOne allele may be dominant while the other is recessive, eye color often being cited, with the brown allele being dominant over the blue allele. This phenomenon has been modeled by the Punnett square for almost a century, before any real knowledge of DNA. As the square suggests, two parents of identical eye color are likely to replicate the color in their child, while a mixed coloring has a 25% chance of producing blue-eyed children.\\n\\nIn truth many genes are competing simultaneously and being expressed differentially, also impacted by post-transcriptional factors and epigenetics, making the precise phenotype expressed more difficult to predict when accounting for these subtleties.\\n\\nAdvances in genetic technology are opening new avenues in terms of personalized medicine, efficient and reliable diagnosis, and highly accurate predictions based on genetic determinants. Broad genetic testing can now be undertaken on a clinically relevant time scale, allowing most DNA-related disorders such as cancer to be specifically identified and combated."

          "data": "However, many detailed links between genetic variants and phenotypes are still not fully understood, and the quantity of data generated by genome sequencing notably outstrips our ability to interpret it. Input from multiple disciplines is increasingly important to obtaining and interpreting such information, and many tools have been developed to capture relevant genomic sequences by classical laboratory and in-silico methods.\\n\\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health predicts that over 60 million people will have had their genome sequenced in a medical context by 2025, and direct consumer testing for purposes other than immediate medical concerns is becoming increasingly popular as the general public becomes more interested in the predictive ability of genomic sequencing. Providers of these services promise insight into one's health and genetic ancestry, though many privacy concerns have been raised regarding this practice.\\n\\nA recent analysis of these companies in the UK found that 15 did not comply with the UK Human Genetics Commission principles for good practice regarding consumer information. One such company based in the USA promised to identify an individual’s “genetic superpower”, and subsequently failed to recognize that a received sample was in fact sourced from a dog, suggesting that the customer would likely be talented at basketball.\\n\\nGene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 is now not only a reality in in vitro experiments but also in human subjects, as on November 25th 2018 He Jianku of the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, announced that two babies had been born with edited C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genes. This modification supposedly rendered the subjects immune to HIV infection, though the reasoning behind this has been challenged by many researchers in the field, and the research was considered risky and unethical in general. He has since been widely condemned for how the research was conducted and has lost his research post and been sentenced to prison time.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the moral standards of the future with regards to gene tailoring of children, though it is certain that it will be possible. If so, parents of the future may be able to choose which of their genes are inherited by their children, or even introduce entirely new traits into their genetic lineage."

The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias [muscle pains], chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision,” the journal said.\n\nAfter undergoing blood and urine tests, he was diagnosed with a bacterial infection called Neisseria meningitidis, which caused his blood to clot and his liver to fail.\n\nHis skin necrosis was said to be caused by “purpura fulminans,” a severe complication of meningococcal septicemia.\n\nThough the incident occurred in March 2021, the case went viral on social media after it was shared by YouTuber Chubbyemu last week.\n\nThe video has received more than one million views."

Variations in the sequence of these genes are called alleles, and differing alleles may interact in a variety of ways depending on the chromosome on which they are located, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic effects.\\n\\nOne allele may be dominant while the other is recessive, eye color often being cited, with the brown allele being dominant over the blue allele. This phenomenon has been modeled by the Punnett square for almost a century, before any real knowledge of DNA. As the square suggests, two parents of identical eye color are likely to replicate the color in their child, while a mixed coloring has a 25% chance of producing blue-eyed children.\\n\\nIn truth many genes are competing simultaneously and being expressed differentially, also impacted by post-transcriptional factors and epigenetics, making the precise phenotype expressed more difficult to predict when accounting for these subtleties.\\n\\nAdvances in genetic technology are opening new avenues in terms of personalized medicine, efficient and reliable diagnosis, and highly accurate predictions based on genetic determinants. Broad genetic testing can now be undertaken on a clinically relevant time scale, allowing most DNA-related disorders such as cancer to be specifically identified and combated."

Input from multiple disciplines is increasingly important to obtaining and interpreting such information, and many tools have been developed to capture relevant genomic sequences by classical laboratory and in-silico methods.\\n\\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health predicts that over 60 million people will have had their genome sequenced in a medical context by 2025, and direct consumer testing for purposes other than immediate medical concerns is becoming increasingly popular as the general public becomes more interested in the predictive ability of genomic sequencing. Providers of these services promise insight into one's health and genetic ancestry, though many privacy concerns have been raised regarding this practice.\\n\\nA recent analysis of these companies in the UK found that 15 did not comply with the UK Human Genetics Commission principles for good practice regarding consumer information. One such company based in the USA promised to identify an individual’s “genetic superpower”, and subsequently failed to recognize that a received sample was in fact sourced from a dog, suggesting that the customer would likely be talented at basketball.\\n\\nGene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 is now not only a reality in in vitro experiments but also in human subjects, as on November 25th 2018 He Jianku of the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, announced that two babies had been born with edited C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genes. This modification supposedly rendered the subjects immune to HIV infection, though the reasoning behind this has been challenged by many researchers in the field, and the research was considered risky and unethical in general. He has since been widely condemned for how the research was conducted and has lost his research post and been sentenced to prison time.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the moral standards of the future with regards to gene tailoring of children, though it is certain that it will be possible. If so, parents of the future may be able to choose which of their genes are inherited by their children, or even introduce entirely new traits into their genetic lineage."

With unemployment expected to remain high, purchasing power will continue to be lower than in other African countries.\n\n“Pharmaceutical spending per capita was calculated at just US$22.2 in 2020 and is expected to increase marginally over the 10-year period, reaching US$25.4 by 2030,” Fitch said\n\nAs drug makers increase their presence in Zimbabwe, the country’s trade deficit growth is seen slowing down.\n\n",

In 2020, pharmaceutical imports reached a value of US$212.2 million  and this is expected to increase US$268.5  million by 2024, experiencing a CAGR of 4,8%.
