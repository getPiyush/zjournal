This paper is concerned with the stability analysis of genetic regulatory networks with interval time-varying delays. Firstly, a relaxed double integral inequality, named as Wirtinger-type double integral inequality (WTDII), is established to estimate the double integral term appearing in the derivative of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with a triple integral term. And it is proved theoretically that the proposed WTDII is tighter than the widely used Jensen-based double inequality and the recently developed Wiringter-based double inequality. Then, by applying the WTDII to the stability analysis of a delayed genetic regulatory network, together"
