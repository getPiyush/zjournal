          "data": "The European Policy Centre strongly condemns Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Its latest acts of military aggression are horrific, unjustified and are in gross violation of international law. There is no doubt their attack will lead to immense human suffering and loss of life.\n\nIt is the people of Ukraine that are now at the forefront of our minds. As they brave death and destruction and valiantly defend their country against Russian terror, we stand by Ukraine and unequivocally support its right as a sovereign state to determine its own future. In the words of European Commission President von der Leyen, “we will not let Russia replace the rule of law with the rule of force and ruthlessness”.\n\nOur mission and work as an organisation are dedicated to upholding and advocating democracy, international cooperation, solidarity, and truth-telling – all the things Putin’s regime abhors and is trying to undo with this act of war. In solidarity with our Ukrainian friends and to keep the free Ukrainian voice in the debate, we are offering free EPC membership to any Ukrainian institution, think tank, and NGO committed to a free and democratic Ukraine.\n\nMake no mistake. What is happening in Ukraine is a direct threat to the global and European security orders put in place 75 years ago. It is a direct threat to the European Union and what it stands for. It is a direct threat to independent liberal democracies everywhere and the values we hold dear: freedom, plurality, equality and respect for the rule of law.\n\nThe time that we thought an all-out war could never touch Europe again is over. But although the situation is bleak, we must take heart in the renewed resolve of the EU and the transatlantic alliance to act together and defend those values. Every time we honour our commitments to our partners, our agreements and our ideals, we prove the likes of Putin wrong and demonstrate that the way forward is not by brute power. In the face of relentless obfuscation and blind aggression, the European Policy Centre is more committed than ever to championing those ideas.",

He would also have purported the ancient Greek theory of the four humors, these being one of the few aspects that might be passed from parents to children.\\n\\nThe circumstances of conception and development were thought significantly more critical to the resulting traits of the child up until the end of the eighteenth century, and until Charles Darwin, in the mid-nineteenth, for heredity to emerge as a central problem in biology. At this point, the properties that an individual inherits became less separated from ones inherited on the species-level in the eyes of science, and modern 20th-century molecular biology generated a plethora of supporting information that confirmed the relationship between individual variation and evolution"

Gametes are the reproductive cells of an organism, which is sperm in males and ova in females. Each of these carries 23 of the 46 chromosomes needed to create a complete human genome, and come together to form a zygote.\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms to develop genetic variation occur at each of these stages. Before the gametes are formed homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of genes on each chromosome. Then during the generation of the gametes by meiosis, the homologous chromosomes are distributed randomly, ensuring that each gamete is unique."

          "data": "Since people possess a homologous pair of each chromosome, usually one from the father and one from the mother, many genes are presented twice. Variations in the sequence of these genes are called alleles, and differing alleles may interact in a variety of ways depending on the chromosome on which they are located, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic effects.\\n\\nOne allele may be dominant while the other is recessive, eye color often being cited, with the brown allele being dominant over the blue allele. This phenomenon has been modeled by the Punnett square for almost a century, before any real knowledge of DNA. As the square suggests, two parents of identical eye color are likely to replicate the color in their child, while a mixed coloring has a 25% chance of producing blue-eyed children.\\n\\nIn truth many genes are competing simultaneously and being expressed differentially, also impacted by post-transcriptional factors and epigenetics, making the precise phenotype expressed more difficult to predict when accounting for these subtleties.\\n\\nAdvances in genetic technology are opening new avenues in terms of personalized medicine, efficient and reliable diagnosis, and highly accurate predictions based on genetic determinants. Broad genetic testing can now be undertaken on a clinically relevant time scale, allowing most DNA-related disorders such as cancer to be specifically identified and combated."

          "data": "However, many detailed links between genetic variants and phenotypes are still not fully understood, and the quantity of data generated by genome sequencing notably outstrips our ability to interpret it. Input from multiple disciplines is increasingly important to obtaining and interpreting such information, and many tools have been developed to capture relevant genomic sequences by classical laboratory and in-silico methods.\\n\\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health predicts that over 60 million people will have had their genome sequenced in a medical context by 2025, and direct consumer testing for purposes other than immediate medical concerns is becoming increasingly popular as the general public becomes more interested in the predictive ability of genomic sequencing. Providers of these services promise insight into one's health and genetic ancestry, though many privacy concerns have been raised regarding this practice.\\n\\nA recent analysis of these companies in the UK found that 15 did not comply with the UK Human Genetics Commission principles for good practice regarding consumer information. One such company based in the USA promised to identify an individual’s “genetic superpower”, and subsequently failed to recognize that a received sample was in fact sourced from a dog, suggesting that the customer would likely be talented at basketball.\\n\\nGene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 is now not only a reality in in vitro experiments but also in human subjects, as on November 25th 2018 He Jianku of the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, announced that two babies had been born with edited C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genes. This modification supposedly rendered the subjects immune to HIV infection, though the reasoning behind this has been challenged by many researchers in the field, and the research was considered risky and unethical in general. He has since been widely condemned for how the research was conducted and has lost his research post and been sentenced to prison time.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the moral standards of the future with regards to gene tailoring of children, though it is certain that it will be possible. If so, parents of the future may be able to choose which of their genes are inherited by their children, or even introduce entirely new traits into their genetic lineage."

The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias [muscle pains], chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision,” the journal said.\n\nAfter undergoing blood and urine tests, he was diagnosed with a bacterial infection called Neisseria meningitidis, which caused his blood to clot and his liver to fail.\n\nHis skin necrosis was said to be caused by “purpura fulminans,” a severe complication of meningococcal septicemia.\n\nThough the incident occurred in March 2021, the case went viral on social media after it was shared by YouTuber Chubbyemu last week.\n\nThe video has received more than one million views."

Variations in the sequence of these genes are called alleles, and differing alleles may interact in a variety of ways depending on the chromosome on which they are located, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic effects.\\n\\nOne allele may be dominant while the other is recessive, eye color often being cited, with the brown allele being dominant over the blue allele. This phenomenon has been modeled by the Punnett square for almost a century, before any real knowledge of DNA. As the square suggests, two parents of identical eye color are likely to replicate the color in their child, while a mixed coloring has a 25% chance of producing blue-eyed children.\\n\\nIn truth many genes are competing simultaneously and being expressed differentially, also impacted by post-transcriptional factors and epigenetics, making the precise phenotype expressed more difficult to predict when accounting for these subtleties.\\n\\nAdvances in genetic technology are opening new avenues in terms of personalized medicine, efficient and reliable diagnosis, and highly accurate predictions based on genetic determinants. Broad genetic testing can now be undertaken on a clinically relevant time scale, allowing most DNA-related disorders such as cancer to be specifically identified and combated."

Input from multiple disciplines is increasingly important to obtaining and interpreting such information, and many tools have been developed to capture relevant genomic sequences by classical laboratory and in-silico methods.\\n\\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health predicts that over 60 million people will have had their genome sequenced in a medical context by 2025, and direct consumer testing for purposes other than immediate medical concerns is becoming increasingly popular as the general public becomes more interested in the predictive ability of genomic sequencing. Providers of these services promise insight into one's health and genetic ancestry, though many privacy concerns have been raised regarding this practice.\\n\\nA recent analysis of these companies in the UK found that 15 did not comply with the UK Human Genetics Commission principles for good practice regarding consumer information. One such company based in the USA promised to identify an individual’s “genetic superpower”, and subsequently failed to recognize that a received sample was in fact sourced from a dog, suggesting that the customer would likely be talented at basketball.\\n\\nGene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 is now not only a reality in in vitro experiments but also in human subjects, as on November 25th 2018 He Jianku of the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, announced that two babies had been born with edited C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genes. This modification supposedly rendered the subjects immune to HIV infection, though the reasoning behind this has been challenged by many researchers in the field, and the research was considered risky and unethical in general. He has since been widely condemned for how the research was conducted and has lost his research post and been sentenced to prison time.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the moral standards of the future with regards to gene tailoring of children, though it is certain that it will be possible. If so, parents of the future may be able to choose which of their genes are inherited by their children, or even introduce entirely new traits into their genetic lineage."

In 2020, pharmaceutical imports reached a value of US$212.2 million  and this is expected to increase US$268.5  million by 2024, experiencing a CAGR of 4,8%.

This hindered the timely effective drainage therapy for AOSPD. Abdominal pain was reported to be observed in 95% of patients with AOSPD;1 therefore, the lack of abdominal pain can be a high risk of diagnostic errors in patients with AOSPD. However, except for abdominal pain, there were almost all the typical characteristics for AOSPD, such as chronic pancreatitis, smoking, habitual drinking, prior pancreatic procedure, low amylase level, high CRP level, dilated pancreatic duct, and pancreatic stones fever, in our patient.1 The same was true of the previously reported case of AOSPD without abdominal pain.1 Besides, retrospectively, the peripancreatic fat stranding on the CT should have been recognized as a clue for AOSPD in this case. Indeed, although the prevalence was low, peripancreatic fat stranding has been reported to be observed in patients with AOSPD.1,2 Therefore, AOSPD should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic pancreatitis who have several characteristics of AOSPD even though they do not have abdominal pain.\n<br/><br/>\nIn conclusion, AOSPD should be thought of as a differential diagnosis in patients with bacteremia of unknown origin, when patients have a history of chronic pancreatitis and other several characteristics of AOSPD, even they do not have abdominal pain. Because these patients require drainage of the pancreatic duct when antibiotic therapy fails, a timely correct diagnosis of AOSPD is necessary. The essential action for the diagnosis of AOSPD is “into the duct”.",

          "data": "Typically, market analyses are performed by pharmaceutical companies. These analyses lead to value propositions and business cases for developing new products based on technologies those companies have either developed, or for which they have licensed intellectual property. These analyses—together with assessments of “end-user” (patient) preferences, and assessments of regulatory pathways—drive research and development (R&D) investments. In traditional for-profit product R&D, the unmet medical need is factored in only partially, including through the end-user preferences and the company’s assessment of likely regulatory authority perspectives. In some cases, governments or multilateral agencies can be large scale procurers (i.e., they will purchase the product), and in this situation their preferences may be given more weight.\n<br/>\nHowever, at present, only a small proportion of global health R&D spending (around 2%) is on the compelling medical problems faced by LMICs.\n<br/>\nOne way to improve this alignment, so that product development meets the world’s medical needs, is for funders and companies to be guided by WHO target product profiles (TPPs). These profiles describe the desired characteristics of a product aimed at tackling a specific disease or diseases. These “state intended use, target populations, and other desired attributes of products, including safety and efficacy-related characteristics.”3\n<br/>\nFor example, in 2008, WHO developed a TPP that laid out the minimum specifications for a vaccine that would save lives by preventing a common type of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 2014, WHO published a TPP for Ebola vaccines. In both cases, the needed vaccines have been developed, licensed, and provided to those most at risk following the preferences articulated by the WHO TPP documents.\n<br/>\nThese two examples show the value of TPPs. If government funders, philanthropists, and industry groups wishing to maximize the public health value of their R&D were to align their funding with WHO TPPs, they would accelerate the production and availability of technologies to curb illness and death.\n<br/>\nWHO TPPs span the most compelling use cases for HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and a number of neglected, vaccine-preventable and emerging infectious diseases. They are developed in all cases with a group of the world’s leading experts including scientists, product developers, public health experts, regulators, and end users from countries in different income levels.\n<br/>\nA WHO TPP document should inform product developers, regulatory agencies, procurement agencies, and funders on R&D and public health priorities. It is intended to facilitate the most expeditious development of products addressing the greatest and most urgent public health need. WHO TPPs recognise that access, equity, and affordability are integral parts of the innovation process and need to be considered at all stages, not just after a product is developed.",

          "data": "Novel pathogens regularly emerge from the animal-human interface, and some, such as SARS-CoV-2, will cause pandemics with incalculable social and economic cost. Yet product development in this area has been highly neglected for decades. CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, receives public and philanthropic funding to advance needed vaccines for emerging infectious diseases that cause serious outbreaks. In discussions between CEPI and WHO, CEPI agreed to refer to WHO’s list of priority pathogens for investment and to advocate that vaccine development should align with WHO TPPs. In CEPI’s review of applications for funding, developers are asked to report on how their vaccine development is aligned with WHO TPP elements. In parallel, developers are encouraged to liaise with WHO early in the process to ensure that data generated will be in line with WHO’s expectations. At the same time, WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) hold financing discussions and WHO engages with CEPI on its access terms (to ensure that any CEPI vaccines will be accessible to low- and middle-income countries).\n<br/>\nThis end-to-end process can accelerate timelines from R&D to use by several years. A concrete example of a development direction from WHO in this area would be the focus on one dose vaccines that prevent transmission as well as disease, wherever possible. While two dose vaccines that prevent disease alone are acceptable for licensure by regulators, one dose transmission-blocking vaccines have much greater value for public health programmes. WHO has made TPPs available to guide needed covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during the ongoing pandemic.\n<br/>\nAnother example is the development of new antibiotics for highly resistant bacteria. Safe and effective antibiotics to treat otherwise incurable highly resistant, fatal bacterial infections are a compelling medical need. However, drug development in this area remains highly neglected. WHO has developed a priority list of the most compelling cases for antibiotic development, and has produced TPPs outlining minimum specifications for needed antibiotics. Ongoing horizon scanning has indicated that the existence of WHO TPPs is driving investment into the needed area, although greater investment and engagement are still needed.",

For example, generating data on suitability of products or devices for use in lower incomes settings can be pivotal in the pathway to use and WHO TPPs can be used to articulate these data needs. Thus, WHO TPPs can drive, not only novel product development, but also data generation that can optimize low- and middle-income country use cases for products already available in higher income settings. Certain cancers, diabetes, and hypertension all have priority indications that could serve as the basis for WHO TPP development",
