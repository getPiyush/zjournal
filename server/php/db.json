He would also have purported the ancient Greek theory of the four humors, these being one of the few aspects that might be passed from parents to children.\\n\\nThe circumstances of conception and development were thought significantly more critical to the resulting traits of the child up until the end of the eighteenth century, and until Charles Darwin, in the mid-nineteenth, for heredity to emerge as a central problem in biology. At this point, the properties that an individual inherits became less separated from ones inherited on the species-level in the eyes of science, and modern 20th-century molecular biology generated a plethora of supporting information that confirmed the relationship between individual variation and evolution"},{"componentId":"kzzuec20v7zdtrqmr0t","componenType":"h3","data":"Inheritance"},{"componentId":"kzzuep7vyb0zemnhmh","componenType":"Paragraph","data":"Inheritance refers to the passing of traits from one generation to the other, both by asexual and sexual reproduction. Gametes are the reproductive cells of an organism, which is sperm in males and ova in females. Each of these carries 23 of the 46 chromosomes needed to create a complete human genome, and come together to form a zygote.\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms to develop genetic variation occur at each of these stages. Before the gametes are formed homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of genes on each chromosome. Then during the generation of the gametes by meiosis, the homologous chromosomes are distributed randomly, ensuring that each gamete is unique."},{"componentId":"kzzufaf68qnajl0dwzf","componenType":"Image","data":"https:\/\/d1g9yur4m4naub.cloudfront.net\/image-handler\/ts\/20210310085914\/ri\/673\/picture\/2021\/3\/shutterstock_1504135007.jpg"},{"componentId":"kzzugg8ft8oyyc6vnfn","componenType":"Paragraph","data":"Since people possess a homologous pair of each chromosome, usually one from the father and one from the mother, many genes are presented twice. Variations in the sequence of these genes are called alleles, and differing alleles may interact in a variety of ways depending on the chromosome on which they are located, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic effects.\\n\\nOne allele may be dominant while the other is recessive, eye color often being cited, with the brown allele being dominant over the blue allele. This phenomenon has been modeled by the Punnett square for almost a century, before any real knowledge of DNA. As the square suggests, two parents of identical eye color are likely to replicate the color in their child, while a mixed coloring has a 25% chance of producing blue-eyed children.\\n\\nIn truth many genes are competing simultaneously and being expressed differentially, also impacted by post-transcriptional factors and epigenetics, making the precise phenotype expressed more difficult to predict when accounting for these subtleties.\\n\\nAdvances in genetic technology are opening new avenues in terms of personalized medicine, efficient and reliable diagnosis, and highly accurate predictions based on genetic determinants. Broad genetic testing can now be undertaken on a clinically relevant time scale, allowing most DNA-related disorders such as cancer to be specifically identified and combated."},{"componentId":"kzzuh3b0lokqoaag2u","componenType":"h3","data":"Recent Developments in Genetics"},{"componentId":"kzzuhfcunahwn5oh7u","componenType":"Paragraph","data":"However, many detailed links between genetic variants and phenotypes are still not fully understood, and the quantity of data generated by genome sequencing notably outstrips our ability to interpret it. Input from multiple disciplines is increasingly important to obtaining and interpreting such information, and many tools have been developed to capture relevant genomic sequences by classical laboratory and in-silico methods.\\n\\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health predicts that over 60 million people will have had their genome sequenced in a medical context by 2025, and direct consumer testing for purposes other than immediate medical concerns is becoming increasingly popular as the general public becomes more interested in the predictive ability of genomic sequencing. Providers of these services promise insight into one's health and genetic ancestry, though many privacy concerns have been raised regarding this practice.\\n\\nA recent analysis of these companies in the UK found that 15 did not comply with the UK Human Genetics Commission principles for good practice regarding consumer information. One such company based in the USA promised to identify an individual\u2019s \u201cgenetic superpower\u201d, and subsequently failed to recognize that a received sample was in fact sourced from a dog, suggesting that the customer would likely be talented at basketball.\\n\\nGene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 is now not only a reality in in vitro experiments but also in human subjects, as on November 25th 2018 He Jianku of the Southern University of Science and Technology, China, announced that two babies had been born with edited C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) genes. This modification supposedly rendered the subjects immune to HIV infection, though the reasoning behind this has been challenged by many researchers in the field, and the research was considered risky and unethical in general. He has since been widely condemned for how the research was conducted and has lost his research post and been sentenced to prison time.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the moral standards of the future with regards to gene tailoring of children, though it is certain that it will be possible. If so, parents of the future may be able to choose which of their genes are inherited by their children, or even introduce entirely new traits into their genetic lineage."}]},{"id":"987391391bbjgj27819391","title":"How Genetic Engineering Impacts Our Life","categryId":"Engineering","author":"Nanda Kishore Bal","dateCreated":"2022-02-23T21:53:44.760Z","dateModified":"2022-03-15T03:41:48.065Z","origin":"server","published":true,"content":[{"componenType":"Image","data":"https:\/\/learn-biology.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/05a_genetic-engineering-overview-lettered.png","altText":"None"},{"componenType":"h4","data":"Abstract"},{"componenType":"Paragraph","data":"Time delay arising in a genetic regulatory network may cause the instability.

(Novavax)\nNovavax is looking for a swift green light in Europe to market its protein-based COVID vaccine Nuvaxovid in teenagers as take-up stalls in adults.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe European Commission, which finalizes all drug approvals and authorizations in Europe, gave its stamp for Nuvaxovid in adults aged 18 and older in December last year. Winning an approval in teens would open up a key target market for the company.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe idea is that Nuvaxovid, which was developed using older vaccine technology seen in flu shots, would be seen as an alternative to the newer mRNA technology used in Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s jabs. And Novavax hoped the so-called vaccine hesitant would thus be more likely to sign up for their first vaccines. In Europe, two other non-mRNA vaccines\u2014from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson\u2014have been hampered by safety concerns.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBut Nuvaxovid has struggled to make much headway on the continent, with figures out from the Koch Institute this month showing pretty dismal numbers from some of Europe\u2019s biggest and most populous countries.\n\n<br\/><br\/>\nBut besides the vaccine hesitant, Novavax sees kids as another target market. And now, it\u2019s sent off a new application to the European Medicines Agency hoping for a quick authorization in those aged 12 to 17 years old, hoping to boost its launch with a significant proportion of the population in Europe.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThere are concerns that, notably with AZ\u2019s vaccine and the two mRNA vaccines, younger people are at a higher risk of certain side effects, namely blood clots (with AZ) and myocarditis (with Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s shots, notably in boys).

(Lexicon Pharmaceuticals)\n<br\/>\nAs the first dual SGLT1\/SGLT2 inhibitor developed for use in diabetes, Lexicon\u2019s sotagliflozin has tantalizing potential. But getting the pill to pass muster with the FDA has been problematic.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe latest setback with the U.S. regulator came five weeks ago when Lexicon pulled back a submission for approval in Type 2 diabetes patients with heart failure. That came on top of an FDA rejection for sotagliflozin in 2019 in Type 1 diabetes.\n<br\/><br\/>\nAll the while, sotagliflozin has generated promising data. On Saturday, at the American College of Cardiology in Washington, D.C., Lexicon highlighted results from a trial of sotagliflozin in Type 2 diabetes and kidney disease patients that showed the drug not only reduced heart failure by 26%, but that it also provided a reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n<br\/><br\/>\nA follow-up analysis of the trial revealed consistent reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in two subgroups\u2014a 21% reduction in MACE in patients with cardiovascular disease and a 26% reduction in MACE in those without CVD.\n<br\/><br\/>\nFor Lexicon chief medical officer Craig Granowitz, the benefit of sotagliflozin in heart failure is no surprise. It\u2019s a class effect that has been shown for other SLGT2 inhibitors, such as Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s Jardiance. But the heart attack and stroke findings could prove an advantage for the medicine against its rivals, Lexicon figures.\n<br\/><br\/>\n\u201cWhat was seen in this study, which hasn\u2019t been seen with SGLT2 inhibitors, is a benefit in reducing heart attack and stroke, whether or not that patient has had a prior heart attack or stroke or has another diagnosis related to cardiovascular disease,\u201d Granowitz said. \u201cThat is why the ACC selected this as a presentation today.\u201d\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe study chair for the Scored trial, Deepak Bhatt, a professor at Harvard Medical School, also noted a consistent benefit for sotagliflozin in three other vascular disease groups\u2014coronary artery disease, cerebral vascular disease and peripheral artery disease.\n<br\/><br\/>\n\u201cThe data are very strong,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cI hope (sotaglifozin) gets approved. I think it might be the best in class.\u201d\n\n<br\/><br\/>\nBhatt said it\u2019s too early to tell if there are added benefits from sotaglifozin because of its dual action. But upcoming studies will leave no doubt.\n<br\/>\n\u201cIs there anything beyond SGLT2 from the SGLT1? Bhatt asked. \u201cThere\u2019s some randomization data that suggests there might be independent benefits.\u201d\n<br\/>\nBy pooling data from phase 2 and phase 3 trials testing sotaglifozin in more than 20,000 combined patients in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, Lexicon has shed more light on the drug\u2019s benefits.\n<br\/><br\/>\n\u201cIf you look at those (other) studies, which were not designed to look at cardiovascular events\u2014they were just designed to look at blood sugar management\u2014you still see a reduction in stroke and heart attack,\u201d Granowitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s never been seen before. That\u2019s pretty remarkable.\u201d\n<br\/><br\/>\nIn the field of diabetes candidates, sotagliflozin is distinguished by its ability to block SGLT2 in the kidneys and SGLT1 in the intestines. Sanofi recognized the drug\u2019s potential in 2015, paying Lexicon $300 million up front and committing $1.4 billion in milestone payments to get a piece of the action.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBut in 2019, while Lexicon gained approval in Europe to treat Type 1 diabetes patients who can\u2019t achieve adequate control of their blood sugar with insulin, it had no such luck in the same indication with the U.S. regulator.\n<br\/>\nAfter an advisory committee deadlocked 8-8 on whether to recommend a nod, the FDA rejected it twice\u2014in March of 2019 and upon appeal nine months later, citing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n<br\/><br\/>\nAlso in 2019\u2014after some mixed trial results\u2014Sanofi bailed on the project, paying $260 million to return full rights to Lexicon.\n\n<br\/><br\/>\nThree years after losing the Type 1 bid, Lexicon has not given up on an approval in that indication, Granowitz said.

But in the meantime, CEO Giovanni Caforio just received a smaller pay package.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBMS awarded Caforio $19.78 million in 2021 pay, down from $20.15 million the prior year, a proxy filing (PDF) shows.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe chief executive saw his salary slightly increase to $1.7 million and stock awards rise nearly half a million dollars to $13.97 million. But Caforio\u2019s cash incentive pay dropped 17% to $3.41 million, a low dating back to 2017.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBMS met or exceeded several targets that it has set to evaluate its executives\u2019 pay. The company\u2019s revenues, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, reached $46.2 billion and came above the company's $45.8 billion target. The board said BMS\u2019 pipeline development also exceeded expectations.\n<br\/><br\/>\nInterestingly, when it comes to Caforio\u2019s personal goal, the board said BMS \u201cexceeded all customer service metrics and supply chain reliability targets,\u201d even though it has publicly described a struggle to meet cell therapy demand because of production constraints.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe company also achieved eight positive pivotal clinical trial results, including for a fixed-dose immuno-oncology combination, which was approved last week by the FDA as Opdualag.\n<br\/><br\/>\n\nBeyond the business metrics, the company\u2019s performance lagged in the \u201chuman capital\u201d category, leading to a 73% payout against that goal. The item focuses on employee engagement and retention by incorporating quarterly employee surveys and voluntary attrition rate. BMS failed to hit target on the quantitative human capital goal, even though the board said it at least met industry benchmarks.\n<br\/>\nLast year, BMS published its inaugural diversity & inclusion report and ESG report. The company has committed to double executive representation of both Black and Latinx employees in the U.S. by the end of 2022.\n<br\/>\nFor Caforio\u2019s personal target, the helmsman \u201cdemonstrated extraordinary leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the company said, as the drugmaker faced no disruption to the supply of medicines to patients and the majority of the U.S. and Puerto Rico vaccinated workforce has returned to the office.\n<br\/><br\/>\nOverall, Caforio got $3.41 million for his cash incentive award against a target of $2.55 million.\n\n<br\/><br\/>\nMeanwhile, the New York pharma is bracing for patent cliffs to the top 3 best-selling drugs in its portfolio, starting with Celgene-inherited blood cancer drug Revlimid this year in the U.S. BMS expects off-patent brands will suffer a revenue decline in the range of $12 billion to $14 billion between 2020 and 2025.\n<br\/><br\/>\nCaforio has devised a plan for BMS, which involves multiple blockbuster launches that it hopes could contribute over $25 billion in total revenue in 2029.

It\u2019s estimated that 70% of women in Britain and 80% of US women have used the pill at some point in their lives, and it remains the most popular form of contraceptive \u2013 prescribed to almost nine out of ten women seeking birth control.\n<br\/>\nThe pill has been instrumental in allowing women choice over children, moving them from the domestic homemaker role that was still typical in the 50s and into the workplace, with greater education, career and lifestyle opportunities \u2013not to mention sexual freedom.\n<br\/>\nKnowledge, however, is still a sticking point. A 2018 study of over 7,500 women from Public Health England (PHE) found that education is a key factor in women being able to manage their reproductive health, and make positive choices. Women of all ages cited school as the place where they had gained most of their information about reproductive health \u2013information that was often basic and out of touch with their lived experiences.\n<br\/>\nMore and more women are turning online to find information and fill this gap, taking proactive control of their own health. Pharma and healthcare brands need to meet this demand and ensure they are visible at the early stages of a woman\u2019s fact-finding journey. For example, vegan-certified condom company Hanx creates a regular stream of relevant, accessible content for women online, providing a platform for frank and light-hearted discussions around sexual wellness. The same goes for menopause education platform Elektra Health, which has carved out a niche in online community support and guidance.\n<br\/>\nThis uptick in digital research and self-help is a flashing beacon for professionals across the product ecosystem to create information in easier, more digestible ways. Ramping up accessibility \u2013 for example, with the new prescription-free contraceptive service at pharmacies \u2013 is part of that process. But it also requires an overhaul of messaging at multiple touchpoints, making conversations around reproductive health less clinical and formal, and more normalised in day-to-day life.\n<br\/><br\/>\nCrucially, it means curating excellent online hubs, full of highly visible, relatable and compelling information to counteract the traditional coded discourse of reproductive health. Doing so will augment women\u2019s fact-finding missions in early stages, driving brand awareness with an approach that feels natural and meaningful.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBreaking taboos with the human touch\n<br\/><br\/>\nBuilding memorable digital support channels goes hand-in-hand with another challenge in women\u2019s reproductive health \u2013 breaking down feelings of shame.\n<br\/>\nIt would be nice to think that the culturally endorsed sexism that clouded earlier pill experiences (most single women didn\u2019t have access to it until 1974) no longer exists today \u2013 but sadly it lives on in a myriad of subtle ways. After all, the modern-day phenomenon of so-called \u2018emergency contraception shaming\u2019 is not unlike the pill being blamed fora rise in sexual promiscuity over half a century before.\n<br\/><br\/>\nLittle wonder, then, that embarrassment is a barrier to accessing support across a spectrum of women\u2019s reproductive issues. This starts in teen years \u2013 nearly half of girls aged 14-21 in the UK are ashamed of their periods \u2013 and continues well into adulthood and older age. Almost a third of women are embarrassed to talk to pharmacists about the morning-after pill, and half of women experiencing menopause feel unable to speak to GPs about their symptoms.\n<br\/><br\/>\nTo break down this avalanche of socially entrenched shame, it\u2019s no longer enough to be functional and clear. We need to go further in speaking to women by creating products that look and feel relevant to them.\n<br\/><br\/>\nIf we look at Hana as an example, when we partnered with HRA Pharma on the launch, it was essential to make the brand feel contemporary and relevant - bridging the tension that exists between efficacy and empowerment. We deliberately used a modern colour palette with Instagram-friendly photography and designed a brand mark that would give Hana a warm and personal feel. Healthcare brand Hers also does a great job at making its selection of sex, skin and hair solutions feel contemporary and human.\n<br\/><br\/>\nIn a wider context, this is about taking deliberate steps to manifest values of openness and empathy into healthcare, empowering women\u2019s reproductive journeys.\n<br\/><br\/>\nA new age of fem care service innovation  \n<br\/><br\/>\nWe live in an age where women are motivated and able to take control of their sexual health and fertility. From period trackers to menopause apps, an emerging wave of Fem-Tech is putting women firmly in charge of their own reproductive choices.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThis newfound awareness naturally filters into market trends, informing new products, product marketing and delivery ideas. With a more empowered audience, brands need to drive innovation to stay relevant. Strategists are carving out ways to find an ongoing connection with their audience and add value beyond a single interaction (as in an OTC purchase) \u2013 staying relevant with the wider dialogue of women\u2019s lives.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThis may take the form of a community awareness platform, like menopause consultants Alva. It could come with a home diagnostic kit such as Juno Bio, or an app such as Clue that makes PMS predictions, enabling women to keep tabs on symptoms.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBrands could also be inspired by Etsy\u2019s growing market of whimsical \u2018tampon cases\u2019 where independent producers are taking ownership of the period narrative with witty slogans such as \u2018shark week\u2019 or \u2018oh bloody hell\u2019. Over on Amazon, pill holders shaped in the form of fruits or mini macarons are making contraception more portable (and fun).\n<br\/>\nIf women won a revolution with the pill 60 years ago, stretching the boundaries of the status quo with the human touch \u2013 revolving around core themes of warmth and accessibility \u2013 will be the next chapter in our quest for reproductive empowerment. The products we create now are central to creating a new set of values and a fresh sexual legacy; both for women now, and girls to come.\n<br\/><br\/>\nDeborah Stafford-Watson is head of Provocation & Strategy UK at Elmwood","numbered":false}],"origin":"server","published":true},{"id":"H0HGmnV","author":"Madhusudhan Das","title":"Fixing the insights gap","dateCreated":"2022-03-05T03:03:27.113Z","dateModified":"2022-04-03T13:06:32.656Z","categryId":"Quality Assurance","content":[{"componentId":"l1j9uf3l9co5wvx1b8q","componenType":"Image","data":"https:\/\/www.pharmatimes.com\/__data\/assets\/image\/0010\/1377334\/shutterstock_629021378.jpg","numbered":false},{"componentId":"l1j9ui5cxc33s5t014m","componenType":"Paragraph","data":"<q>Proper insights are the eyes and ears of the life science industry. Without them, or without the proper use of them, pharma companies are flying blind.<\/q>\n<br\/>\nFor the life science sector, an insight is a fundamental truth about customers that gives better understanding of the patient. They can come from various sources, be it healthcare professionals, payers, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), or patients themselves.\n<br\/>\nWhen used effectively, they can open new markets, accelerate product development, and strengthen relationships between patients and KOLs. But right now, they aren\u2019t being used effectively. We call this the life sciences insight gap - when insights aren\u2019t collected, shared, or utilised properly.\n<br\/><br\/>\nThe ripple effect of this delay is costly, both in time and money. To date, fewer than 10% of drugs in development make it to market from phase I trials. On top of this, those drugs that do make it cost an average of $2bn to from conception to commercialisation.\n<br\/><br\/>\nBottom line - the insights gap costs. Pharma companies can\u2019t afford to work with the wrong KOLs, engage them in the wrong way, or process the data incorrectly. They need better insights. Here is how they can get them.\n<br\/><br\/>\n<b>Select the right people<\/b>\n<br\/><br\/>\nWho you talk to is important. For Medical Science Liaisons (MSLs), it\u2019s the first hurdle, and the whole process can fall down here. Especially during the pandemic, when in person connection was limited, MSLs tend to stick to tried and tested relationships with the same small group of KOLs each time. Whilst valuable, engaging the same KOLs on a repeat basis limits the number of insights you can gain by narrowing the pool of voices.\n<br\/>\nMSL teams should adopt an insights-first approach, not a KOL-first one. Often, the most obvious stakeholder may not be the best one. For instance, the default assumption is often that HCPs who are on the frontline of treatment and prescribing are the most knowledgeable. However, for some areas, nurses or other health care providers may have the knowledge companies need to engage with.\n<br\/>\nSometimes, the right opinion leader isn\u2019t one that\u2019s typically engaged at all. Young professionals, or people who are branching out into new areas are often overlooked but hold a strong level of influence over their peers.\n<br\/>\nBy thinking with an insights-first approach, medical teams can avoid repetitive, out of date information and engage KOLs at the frontline of what they really need.\n\n<br\/><br\/>\n<b>Connect for the 21st century<\/b>\n<br\/><br\/>\nAs many life science companies learnt during the pandemic, video conferencing isn\u2019t the panacea they hoped. Digital fatigue contributed to more meetings, longer working hours and the tendency to drift from the task at hand all lowered the quality of insights.\n<br\/>\nWith stakeholders located across the globe, organising a video call became a logistical nightmare. But are lengthy, one-to-one video calls the way forward? If gaining meaningful insights is essential to your business, then the answer is no.\n<br\/>\nBut as many of pharma\u2019s top 20 learnt over the last 18 months, the best insights are gained through over-time, asynchronous engagement.\n<br\/>\nKOLs are time-pressed, spread out globally, and often isolated by language barriers. Asynchronous engagement allows KOLs to be connected with on their terms, when they\u2019re able to. Insights can be managed, shared and gathered in a timely manner, which often shortens the process whilst improving the quality of the results.\n<br\/><br\/>\nOn top of this, factors that widen the insights gap, including poor attendance, lack of preparation and the tendency for dominant personalities to control the discussion can all be avoided. The result is a more efficient way of engaging KOLs that delivers a complete set of insights.\n<br\/><br\/>\nDiscover actionable data, not raw insights\n<br\/><br\/>\nSuccessful insight gathering begins before any questions have been asked, and it continues long after they have been. Through targeted KOL selection and asynchronous connection, medical teams can gain a deep selection of insights, but what should they do with them?\n<br\/>\nLong transcripts and notes can be helpful, but they\u2019re not what teams need to make decisions. Most life science teams are short of time, and often short of the capability to sift through mountains of data. Fortunately, there are multiple ways teams can get around this.\n<br\/>\nAn executive summary of the insights can go a long way. In a timely manner, executive summaries don\u2019t interrupt the next stage of the process but provide easy-access information that protects medical team\u2019s time.\n<br\/>\nAdditionally, tech-based solutions, such as data analysis software can help teams easily understand the result of their engagements. Solutions like this can remove personal opinion, guesswork and ambiguity from the situation and leave clear, actionable insights ready for decision making.\n\n<br\/><br\/>\n<b>An integrated approach<\/b>\n<br\/>\nThe insights gap is holding the life science industry back. Identifying who to target, how to target them and what to do with the results are all critical elements in good decision making, and right now, life science companies are falling short.\n<br\/>\nAt Within3, we know the importance of these insights in delivering drugs to patients. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working to fix this problem with our new Insights Management Platform. The platform, which combines Select, Connect, Discover under one roof, will allow companies to close the insights gap across the full development process. For too long, life science companies have had minimal help in fixing this problem, so we\u2019re out to change that.\n<br\/><br\/>\nby Lance Hill, CEO, Within3","numbered":false}],"origin":"server","published":true},{"id":"6Iwo3lr","author":"Madhusudhan Das","title":"Sanofi and IGM Biosciences team up to develop antibody agonists","dateCreated":"2022-04-03T11:14:07.505Z","dateModified":"2022-04-03T12:26:20.456Z","categryId":"Quality Control","content":[{"componentId":"l1j9690kg6rx60splfs","componenType":"Image","data":"https:\/\/www.pharmatimes.com\/__data\/assets\/image\/0009\/1387278\/Sanofi.jpg","numbered":false},{"componentId":"l1j96m5b32d4c6qc3g6","componenType":"Paragraph","data":"Collaboration will involve the development of new class IgM antibodies with a view to gaining market approval\n<br\/>\nSanofi and IGM have announced the signing of a collaboration agreement to create, develop, manufacture and commercialise IgM antibody agonists against three oncology and three immunology\/inflammation targets.\n<br\/>\nEngineered IgM antibodies represent a new class of potential therapeutics which combine the multi-valency of IgM antibodies, which possess ten binding sites, compared to conventional IgG antibodies, which have only two target binding sites.\n<br\/>\nUnder the terms of the collaboration, IGM will receive a $150m upfront payment and, for each oncology target collaboration programme, IGM will lead research and development activities.

If you don't certify your tax status, you may be subject to backup withholding.\nWhat is backup withholding?\nIf you're an employee, your employer probably withholds income tax from your paycheck and pays it to the IRS in your name. Similarly, if you don't confirm your tax status and are subject to backup withholding, we are required to withhold a portion of your proceeds from sales, dividends, and interest payments to cover your potential US tax liability. If your tax bill ends up being less than what we withheld, you should be entitled to claim a refund on your next tax return.\nGenerally, Robinhood will only apply this type of backup withholding if you don't confirm your tax status.\nYou can find information on certifying your tax status, backup withholding, and more in our Help Center.\n- The Robinhood Team","dateContacted":"2022-04-21T09:33:08.475Z","id":"626124d5089c0"},{"name":"eeqeqjkhk","email":"ljkljk@khj.hh","phone":"+91 58785-78587","comment":"Hardware Upgrade\nCongrats!
