You can prep with interviewing question books or even doing a quick search on Google to find common interviewer questions related to your field.</p><h3><strong>8. Be Honest</strong></h3><p>At the end of the day, be yourself. If you truly don’t know the answer to a question, communicate that to the interviewer, but let them know that you’re more than willing to learn. Your future employer will want to know that they can communicate openly with you, so honesty is key, even if you fear it may hurt your job prospects.</p><h3><strong>9. Be Proactive</strong></h3><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter img-fluid -7607" title="Technical Interview, be proactive" src="https://www.menwithkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3059924-300x200.jpg" alt="Technical Interview, be proactive" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.menwithkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3059924-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.menwithkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3059924.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p>First impressions are important, so do everything you can to make sure this is a great one.
